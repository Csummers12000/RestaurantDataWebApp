# Restaurant Data Web App
A web app designed to display live health inspection data on restaurants in Prince Georges County, MD.  This repository was cloned from the one hosted by my School associated GitHub account.  The collaborator Summersc98 is me (Csummers12000) and the other two collaborators were my teammates.  You can view the finished Web App here: https://fastfoodtypeaheadgetrequests.herokuapp.com/
